# Force Railway Rebuild
# Updated: 2026-02-04 14:20

This file is touched to force Railway to rebuild.

## What's Fixed:
- Fixed import path: routers.auth -> api.auth
- Added debug logging for router imports
- All routers should now mount successfully

## Expected in logs:
```
✅ auth_router imported
✅ configs_router imported
✅ bot_router imported
✅ All routers successfully mounted!
```
